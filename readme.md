# GAWDI-12 Project-1: Khoi's Simon Game
Simon is a simple game that emphasizes memory. The key of the game is to mimic the buttons that light up in the exact order. As you mimic each button, it add's another button to memorize.
## Installation
To install, clone down a copy from my personal github repo. Then run the index.html in a web browser (pref chrome).
## Usage
The game doesn't get any simpler than this! Simply press the play button and start memorizing. The reset button refreshes the page so you can start all over!

## History
The commit history involves 5 commits.
1: Initial Commit. Here the board was created along with the basic functions of the game.
2:Functionality. This commit involved a bit of tuning to the javascript.
3:CSS tuning. This commit made the board more aesthetically appealing.
4:Randomize Function: This is where the game got more challenging. By adding a randomize function, it allows the game to be random rather than a previous set up cycle.
5: Silver Level. Audio was added, and the functionality is correct.

## To Do
Although the game is simple, there are plenty of bugs to sort out. To name a few..
  1. The board does not light up the previous button to memorize.
  2. The code is a bit long and disorganized.
  3. The CSS could be better

## User Stories
As a player, I start the game by pressing player.
As a player, I want to be able to press the buttons with issues.
As a player, I want to be able to see the score.
As a player, I want to be able to distinguish which colors are printing.
As a player, I want it to be clear when I lose.
As a player, I want audio so the game is more interactive.

## Technologies Used
The main technologies used were HTML, CSS, and Javascript, along with jQuery,
HTML was used for the content, CSS was used to style/color the board, and Javascript produces the interactive functions.
